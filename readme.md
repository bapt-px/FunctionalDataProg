Run the function "compare" to start to analyse the data.
Each function got the data through the "loadData" function that convert all data into the files drone_X.json to "Data" object compareForTemperature compare for each data of each drone the altitude, location and speed for different temperatures available, so if an area or the speed affect the temperature, it made it obvious to the showing of the results. 
compareForBattery do the same as before with the speed, trying to determine if the speed affects the battery usage. 
isDefaillant notice if a temperature unnatural is detected  hasFall detect if a high speed falling is detected and there is no more data from this drone since this record
